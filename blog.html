                <h3>What is the Document Object Model (DOM)?</h3>
                <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the
                    structure of an HTML or XML document as a tree of objects, where each node is an element (such as a
                    tag, attribute, or text). Through the DOM, programming languages like JavaScript can access and
                    manipulate the content, structure, and style of web pages dynamically. This allows you to change
                    elements, add content, or modify styles after a web page has been loaded.</p>

                <h3>How do you select an element from the DOM?</h3>
                <p>Selecting an element from the Document Object Model (DOM) can be accomplished through various
                    methods, each suited for different scenarios. The getElementById(id) method retrieves a unique
                    element based on its ID, while getElementsByClassName(className) and getElementsByTagName(tagName)
                    allow for selecting multiple elements by their class names or tag names, respectively. For more
                    advanced selections, querySelector(selector) retrieves the first matching element based on a CSS
                    selector, and querySelectorAll(selector) returns all elements matching the selector. These methods
                    enable developers to efficiently access and manipulate elements, facilitating dynamic interactions
                    within web applications. Understanding these techniques is crucial for effective DOM manipulation in
                    JavaScript.</p>

                <h3>What is event delegation in the context of the DOM, and why is it useful?</h3>
                <p>Event delegation allows you to attach a single event listener to a parent element, which handles
                    events triggered by its child elements. This works through event bubbling, where events propagate up
                    the DOM tree. It improves performance by reducing the number of event listeners and is particularly
                    useful for dynamically added elements.</p>

                <h3>How do you manipulate an element's attributes and styles using the DOM?</h3>
                <p>Manipulating an element's attributes and styles using the DOM involves leveraging specific methods
                    and properties. To set or change an attribute, developers can utilize the setAttribute() method,
                    which allows for dynamic updates to elements, such as changing an image source. Additionally,
                    attributes can be accessed with getAttribute() and removed using removeAttribute(). For styling, the
                    style property is employed, enabling direct modifications to CSS properties, like altering
                    background colors or font sizes. This flexibility allows for responsive and interactive web designs,
                    enhancing user experience through real-time updates. Overall, these techniques are essential for
                    effective DOM manipulation in web development.</p>
